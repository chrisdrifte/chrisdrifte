## Projects

### [AI SpaceFactory](https://spacefactory.ai/)
David Malott designed 3 of the world's tallest buildings. Over the years, I've worked directly alongside David to supply various projects, including websites, internal tools, and a metaverse experience built on the Polygon blockchain.

### [NUMA Air](https://www.numaproducts.com/)
I provided key technical advice during the initial development of NUMA Air, as well as developed the MVP app in use at Google's NYC offices, Pier 57. At my suggestion, NUMA added a screen to their devices which reduced overall costs and simplified the user experience.

As the sole developer at KOLAPS, I implemented complex animated designs with React and Typescript.

His sharp intellect and sense of humor are also a great addition to any team.

## Off-Screen

I've spent more than 22 years living outside my home country, working jobs that range from stand-up comedy and carpentry, to teaching English and playing music in the street. I've published books, run marathons, and even walked Spain coast-to-coast. When I'm not working, I'm rock climbing or organizing hikes. Life is never boring!
