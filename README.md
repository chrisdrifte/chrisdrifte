## Projects

### [Bike24 Search Results Page](https://bike24.com/search-result?searchTerm=abus)
I was the driving force behind implementing a best-in-class search results page - twice as fast as amazon.com. 

### [AI SpaceFactory](https://spacefactory.ai/)
David Malott designed 3 of the world's tallest buildings. Over the years, I've worked directly alongside David to supply various projects, including websites, internal tools, and a metaverse experience built on the Polygon blockchain.

### [NUMA Air](https://www.numaproducts.com/)
I provided key technical advice during the initial development of NUMA Air, as well as developed the MVP app in use at Google's NYC offices, Pier 57. At my suggestion, NUMA added a screen to their devices which reduced overall costs and simplified the user experience.

As the sole developer at KOLAPS, I provided technical advice throughout the delivery process, managed projects, and implemented complex animated designs with React and Typescript.

### Hasan, Director at KOLAPS

He is meticulous and technically highly capable. He was also always able to cover any know-how gaps he might have by acquiring knowledge and understanding very rapidly. His sharp intellect and sense of humor are also a great addition to any team.

## Off-Screen

I have a great love for adventure. With more than 22 years living outside my home country, I've been a stand-up comic, radio host, carpenter, English teacher, street musician, and published author. I competed nationally in rock climbing (USA), walked Spain coast-to-coast, and climbed various mountains across 4 continents.
